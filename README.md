BeanCrumbs
==========

Annotation processor that extracts Java beans metadata and generates other code. 


The name
--------

The library is called after bread crumbs strewed by [Hansel and Gretel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansel_and_Gretel) from the famous tail recorded by Brothers Grimm. 


What does it do?
----------------

Exactly as bread crumbs leaved by Hansel showed the way back this library helps to create other code based on metadata extracted from original beans.
